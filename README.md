## Welcome to GitHub Pages

To advance research on Detecting domain generation algorithms (DGA) generated domain name and to enable a comparison of different detection approaches, we make the dataset, AmritaDGA from our project [Detecting malicious domain names](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Detecting-malicious-domain-names) publicy available. AmritaDGA data set is avilable for research. This data set is used as part of [DMD2018](https://nlp.amrita.edu/DMD2018/) organized by [Cybersecurity group at CEN](https://vinayakumarr.github.io/Cybersecurity-Lab-at-CEN/) as part of [ICACCI'18](http://icacci-conference.org/2018/) and [SSCC'18](http://www.acn-conference.org/sscc2018/).
